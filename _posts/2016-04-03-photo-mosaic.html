      Objectives
    </h4>
    <p>
      This application is in order to learnt about Canvas. In this case I will be provided with a photo, I will separate in tiles the photo, take the average color from each tile and show an svg in order to make a composite.
    </p>
    <div class="centered-image">
      <img src="{{ "images/PhotoMosaic.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="How the application photo mosaic produce results" itemprop="image">
    </div>
    <p>
      As you can see the user just selected a file, and then press on create mosaic in order to get a mosaic composition per tile with the average color.

      How did I work with the images?
    </h4>
    <p>
      First I just take the initial picture from the file with FileReader of HTML5.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I just use this as source for a canvas not visible for the user.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this canvas I just separate each tile with a configuration parameter WIDTH HEIGHT.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I just take from each tile an average color, this is provided by a canvas context function called. Get Image Data, this function is great it gives an array with all the image data in the section of the context canvas written per tile.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Get Image Data brings an array that works by 4 positions bringing the values of RGBA, so per each 4 position you can get an average of each color.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thats all you just need to write a canvas. So I get a template svg in order to bring a little circle to it with the average color, it could be something else but this is fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally I just placed the original image as a background of the canvas in order to bring the composition.
    </p>

      Conclusion
    </h4>
    <p>
      Learned about Canvas and Image processing bringing to light common used functions in order to manipulate those images.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of this is with vanilla javascript.
