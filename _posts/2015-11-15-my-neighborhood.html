      Objectives
    </h4>
    <p>
      For Udacity Front End Nanodegree we needed to build an application for my neighborhood, that uses Knockout, Google Maps and one more service, I choosed Foursquare API.

      This is not my actual neighborhood, but I lived there for more than 20 years, and I am sharing some of those place I went.

    <p>
      Knockout is a nice framework for doing somethings without using jQuery, and using a pattern of MVVM.
