        Objectives
      </h4>
      <p>
        We will see a bit of configuration from karma and an example of a working enviroment for testing and coverage.
        This is presented as a solution with ECMA5. In order to go for ECMA6 I recommend look for babelify transformation.
        For impatients  you can find the repo <a href="https://github.com/jotaoncode/web-istanbul">here</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The karma configuration we will be analyzing will be <a href="https://github.com/jotaoncode/web-istanbul/blob/master/karma.local.conf.js" target="_blank">this one</a>
      </p>
  </section>
  <section itemprop="articleSection">
    <h4 itemprop="name">
      Pre requisites
    </h4>
    <p>
      In this case we need to have installed nodejs, npm, and karma, mocha, phantomjs and expect for assertion.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section itemprop="articleSection">
    <h4 itemprop="name">
      Defining Karma Reporters
    </h4>
    <p>
      We will define what we want from Karma, and thats going to be with this line:
    </p>
{% highlight javascript %}
reporters: ['spec', 'coverage']
{% endhighlight %}
    <p>
    So we are going to give a report on coverage and run spec too. So in order to do so we need some dependencies in package json those are:
    </p>
{% highlight javascript %}
karma-spec-reporter,
karma-coverage
{% endhighlight %}
  </section>
  <section itemprop="articleSection">
    <h4 itemprop="name">
      Defining Karma Frameworks
    </h4>
    <p>
    Then we can say which frameworks we will be using to karma.
    </p>
{% highlight javascript %}
frameworks: [
  'mocha',
  'browserify'
],
{% endhighlight %}
    <p>
    You can see that we are using mocha for runing those tests, and browserify to make a bundle on what we need to test.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section itemprop="articleSection">
    <h4 itemprop="name">
      Files to test.
    </h4>
    <p>
    What are we going to test?, we can define a regular expression to say where are the source files of our application and where are the tests.
    </p>
{% highlight javascript %}
files: [
  'src/**/*.js',
  'test/*.js'
],
{% endhighlight %}
  </section>
  <section itemprop="articleSection">
    <h4 itemprop="name">
      Preprocess some files
    </h4>
    <p>
    We need to define what we will be running before processing all the data with karma.
    </p>
{% highlight javascript %}
  'src/**/*.js': ['browserify', 'coverage'],
  'test/**/*.js': ['browserify']
{% endhighlight %}
    <p>
    In this case we are saying, execute browserify to bundle my source code <strong>then</strong> execute coverage.
    </p>
    <p>
    Then we say execute browserify on test.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section itemprop="articleSection">
    <h4 itemprop="name">
      Coverage Reporter
    </h4>
    <p>
    In this case you can specify some operations for those reports you defined before. You can add some customs and say how to do somethings to karma for those reports.
    </p>
{% highlight javascript %}
coverageReporter: {
  reporters: [
    { type: 'html' },
    { type: 'text' },
    { type: 'lcovonly' }
  ],
  instrumenterOptions: {
    istanbul: {
      noCompact: true
    }
  },
  instrumenter: {
    'test/**/*.js': 'istanbul'
  },
  includeAllSources: true
},
{% endhighlight %}
    <p>
    In this case we are saying that we want results in <strong>html, text, lcovonly</strong>. We are saying we will use Istanbul as an instrumenter to produce this coverage. lcov is the result the coverage, it is information formatted in a particular way so you can read from this lcov in order to produce a report in the way you need with different tools. So we can say that you can use other libraries that are not Istanbul and they may produce lcov information too.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section itemprop="articleSection">
    <h4 itemprop="name">
      Browserify transformations
    </h4>
    <p>
    As we have defined browserify early we may need to define how to make some transformations for our bundles.
    </p>
{% highlight javascript %}
browserify: {
  debug: true,
  transform: [ 'brfs', istanbul({
    ignore: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/test/**']
  })]
}
{% endhighlight %}
    <p>
    So we are saying run brfs, this is a plugin that will inline the reading of files into bundles, and <strong>then</strong> istanbul will actually work with the coverage ignoring node modules and tests.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section itemprop="articleSection">
    <h4 itemprop="name">
      Defining your browser
    </h4>
    <p>
    You can define your browser for karma like this:
    </p>
{% highlight javascript %}
    browsers: [
      'PhantomJS2'//, 'Firefox'
    ],
{% endhighlight %}
    <p>
    PhantomJS2 is a headless browser that avoids having so much heavy work when running tests in browser.
    You can see compatibility table for PhantomJS2 in <a href="http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/#phantom">here</a>
    </p>
  </section>
  <section itemprop="articleSection">
    <h4 itemprop="name">
      Running karma
    </h4>
    <p>
    Finally we run karma with this line:
    </p>
    <code>rm -r coverage && karma start karma.local.conf.js</code>
    <p>The results on this coverage are in my terminal are this ones:</p>
    <div class="centered-image">
      <img src="{{ "images/npm-test-results.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Report written in terminal for karma coverage" itemprop="contentUrl">
    </div>
    <p>The results on this coverage in my browser are:</p>
    <div class="centered-image">
      <img src="{{ "images/coverage-report.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Report written in terminal for karma coverage" itemprop="contentUrl">
    </div>
    <p>We can explore those results a bit more and find the lines not covered</p>
    <div class="centered-image">
      <img src="{{ "images/index-coverage.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Report written in terminal for karma coverage" itemprop="contentUrl">
    </div>
  </section>
  <section itemprop="articleSection">
    <h4 itemprop="name">
      Conclusion
    </h4>
    <p>Now we know how to run our testing with coverage in a headless browser. There are several reasons why testing is important, soon we will see a nice approach in this same project with Continuous Integration, Github and for multiple platforms.</p>
