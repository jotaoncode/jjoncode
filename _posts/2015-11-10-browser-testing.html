            Browser Testing
          </h3>
          <h4>
            Objectives
          </h4>
          <p>
            We will see a bit of configuration from karma and an example of a working enviroment for testing and coverage.
            This is presented as a solution with ECMA5. In order to go for ECMA6 I recommend look for babelify transformation.
            For impatients  you can find the repo <a href="https://github.com/jotaoncode/web-istanbul">here</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            The karma configuration we will be analyzing will be <a href="https://github.com/jotaoncode/web-istanbul/blob/master/karma.local.conf.js" target="_blank">this one</a>
          </p>

          <h4>
            Pre requisites
          </h4>
          <p>
            In this case we need to have installed nodejs, npm, and karma, mocha, phantomjs and expect for assertion.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Defining Karma Reporters
          </h4>
          <p>
            We will define what we want from Karma, and thats going to be with this line:
          </p>
{% highlight javascript %}
reporters: ['spec', 'coverage']
{% endhighlight %}
          <p>
          So we are going to give a report on coverage and run spec too. So in order to do so we need some dependencies in package json those are:
          </p>
{% highlight javascript %}
karma-spec-reporter,
karma-coverage
{% endhighlight %}
        <h4>
          Defining Karma Frameworks
        </h4>
        <p>
        Then we can say which frameworks we will be using to karma.
        </p>
{% highlight javascript %}
frameworks: [
  'mocha',
  'browserify'
],
{% endhighlight %}
        <p>
        You can see that we are using mocha for runing those tests, and browserify to make a bundle on what we need to test.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Files to test.
        </h4>
        <p>
        What are we going to test?, we can define a regular expression to say where are the source files of our application and where are the tests.
        </p>
{% highlight javascript %}
files: [
  'src/**/*.js',
  'test/*.js'
],
{% endhighlight %}
        <h4>
          Preprocess some files
        </h4>
        <p>
        We need to define what we will be running before processing all the data with karma.
        </p>
{% highlight javascript %}
  'src/**/*.js': ['browserify', 'coverage'],
  'test/**/*.js': ['browserify']
{% endhighlight %}
        <p>
        In this case we are saying, execute browserify to bundle my source code <strong>then</strong> execute coverage.
        </p>
        <p>
        Then we say execute browserify on test.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Coverage Reporter
        </h4>
        <p>
        In this case you can specify some operations for those reports you defined before. You can add some customs and say how to do somethings to karma for those reports.
        </p>
{% highlight javascript %}
coverageReporter: {
  reporters: [
    { type: 'html' },
    { type: 'text' },
    { type: 'lcovonly' }
  ],
  instrumenterOptions: {
    istanbul: {
      noCompact: true
    }
  },
  instrumenter: {
    'test/**/*.js': 'istanbul'
  },
  includeAllSources: true
},
{% endhighlight %}
        <p>
        In this case we are saying that we want results in <strong>html, text, lcovonly</strong>. We are saying we will use Istanbul as an instrumenter to produce this coverage. lcov is the result the coverage, it is information formatted in a particular way so you can read from this lcov in order to produce a report in the way you need with different tools. So we can say that you can use other libraries that are not Istanbul and they may produce lcov information too.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Browserify transformations
        </h4>
        <p>
        As we have defined browserify early we may need to define how to make some transformations for our bundles.
        </p>
{% highlight javascript %}
browserify: {
  debug: true,
  transform: [ 'brfs', istanbul({
    ignore: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/test/**']
  })]
}
{% endhighlight %}
        <p>
        So we are saying run brfs, this is a plugin that will inline the reading of files into bundles, and <strong>then</strong> istanbul will actually work with the coverage ignoring node modules and tests.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Defining your browser
        </h4>
        <p>
        You can define your browser for karma like this:
        </p>
{% highlight javascript %}
    browsers: [
      'PhantomJS2'//, 'Firefox'
    ],
{% endhighlight %}
        <p>
        PhantomJS2 is a headless browser that avoids having so much heavy work when running tests in browser.
        You can see compatibility table for PhantomJS2 in <a href="http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/#phantom">here</a>
        </p>
        <h3>
          Running karma
        </h3>
        <p>
        Finally we run karma with this line:
        </p>
        <code>rm -r coverage && karma start karma.local.conf.js</code>
