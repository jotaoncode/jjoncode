      Objectives
    </h4>
    <p>
      This application was builded on 2014. I did not know a lot of things, and a Manager asked me to work on a development similar to google tranding cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not know very well how to work with this, and one of the main reasons was because I did not worked in CSS3 transformations too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the very first release of this application I just keep on working motivated by the reason that I just learn too much on this development. One of my companions at work, looked at me knowing I was in a hurry in order to make this application possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea is just to give some cards in a grid, and those cards will actually be updated by doing random transitions up - down - left and right.

      The Versions
    </h4>
    <p>
      The first approach of this application actually was not made by me, it was solved by using some ideas from the internet and had so many cards that actually make a tilt on my computer :s.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first approach actually creates and destroy some of the cards, by making a very bad experience and flashes the final user with the white background.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second approach was with a companion at work with a higher seniority and experience than me in CSS. It was far more smothie.
      Also we improved the work with the quantity of cards, actually I received thousends of cards, so we have to work a bit on the random in order to avoid the CPU consuption.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third approach was about just improving the technologies, and the separation of concerns, I also added a bit of continuous integration even though it did not have many tests and just in order to keep on learning, I added travis, coveralls, saucelabs, karma to the project.

      Conclusion
    </h4>
    <p>
      In this case we see a bit more about frameworks. Backbone Marionette and CSS. We worked with Layouts, Collections, Collection Views, Item Views, and CSS3 transitions.
