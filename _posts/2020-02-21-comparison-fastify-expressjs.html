      Conclusion
    </h4>
    <p>
      The both of them are great frameworks, summarizing the use cases for each one I would say that fastify:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Schema validation out of the box</li>
      <li>This validation is a common factor in many APIs and this could help to provide a more homogeneus solution cross APIs</li>
      <li>Claims to have a good performance in general, but I was not able to measure this point</li>
      <li>Provides logging out of the box</li>
      <li>Extensible using Hooks, but pay attention that this belongs to lifecycle and then any change in this regards could impact a product implementation</li>
      <li>Extensible using Decorators, but pay attention to when and how to use them in each use case, in order to not have an impact in maintanability on the product</li>
      <li>Extensible using Plugins, fastify claims to have a good community and source of plugins. This is a rich aspect.</li>
      <li>Is developer friendly, because taking away common problems with configuration makes the develop to focus on solving particular needs of the business.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Express Js:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Very mature, first commit of this framework was in 2009</li>
      <li>Huge community and middlewares that can help to solve common problems</li>
      <li>Extensible using middlewares</li>
      <li>In some use cases could have more work than fastify. I believe configs of fastify helps a lot here.</li>
      <li>The same logs could be provided to Express as in fastifyJs</li>
      <li>Very flexible and easy to use</li>
      <li>So much flexibility can come with the need of extra effort to make things similar and homogeneus accross several APIs</li>
    </ul>
