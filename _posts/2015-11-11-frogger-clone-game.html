            Frogger Game Clone
          </h3>
          <p>
            For Udacity Front End Nanodegree we needed to build a frogger clone game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Udacity provided assets and rendering engine. The challenge here was to create player and enemies, the game logic and colissions between the bugs and the player.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also we needed to make it work in 60 fps creating those objects needed. In order to achieve this we need to work with prototype so we can actually create what the player or the enemy without having a great waste on memory.
          </p>
          <p>
            The final results are very nice. This is the picture of it, and you can play with it in <a href="http://jotaoncode.herokuapp.com/frogger/">here</a>. In the future I will actually improve this game a bit more.
