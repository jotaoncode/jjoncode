      The art
    </h4>
    <p>
      Well, everything of this game is mine, in exception with the explosion and the laser fire that I took from another game in the examples of phaser js.

      Game Instructions
    </h4>
    <p>
      You can move the spaceship with the cursors, and you can fire with the space bar. It is very similar to galaxian but only with 4 enemies XD. If any of this aliens touchs you, you loose. Have fun!

      Conclusion
    </h4>
    <p>
      In this case we see a bit more about frameworks. Backbone Marionette and CSS. We worked with Layouts, Collections, Collection Views, Item Views, and CSS3 transitions.
