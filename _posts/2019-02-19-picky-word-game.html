      The art
    </h4>
    <p>
      Everything created for this game was done by scratch by me, and the very begining was kind of how should I start?
      Basically it is a book where you write synonyms / antonyms considering a hint of letters you can use for a given word.
    </p>

  <section itemprop="articleSection">
    <h4 itemprop="headline">
      From scratch
    </h4>
    <p>
      So everything started with some sort of idea, and no clue of how to create anything.
    </p>
    <div class="centered-image">
      <img src="{{ "images/someIdeas.png" | prepend: site.url }}" alt="first ideas" itemprop="image">
    </div>
    <p>
      Not less, ugly but still a bit of a progress, I tried to do things in a different way. I started to search for a name...
    </p>
    <div class="centered-image">
      <img src="{{ "images/betterIdeas.png" | prepend: site.url }}" alt="better ideas" itemprop="image" style="max-width: 50%">
    </div>
    <p>
      After doing some brainstorming with words and so on... I came with the idea of creating a game of words where the person became a bit more "picky" in the chosing words he use when he wants to express.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I tried to learn a bit of illustrator, and I feel that make a better advance.
    </p>
    <div class="centered-image">
      <img src="{{ "images/presentation.png" | prepend: site.url }}" alt="presentation" itemprop="image">
    </div>

  <section itemprop="articleSection">
    <h4 itemprop="headline">
      Game Selection
    </h4>
    <p>
      The game currently has only one language, one country, but could support several countries and languages. The intention is to be able to choose what you want to learn in the language you decide.
    </p>
    <div class="centered-image">
      <img src="{{ "images/selection.png" | prepend: site.url }}" alt="game selection" itemprop="image">
    </div>
  </section>
  <section itemprop="articleSection">
    <h4 itemprop="headline">
      Game Instructions
    </h4>
    <p>
      So what I want is that each person can get more words from synonyms and antonyms. Thats what the game is for, learning while playing.
    </p>
    <div class="centered-image">
      <img src="{{ "images/instructions.png" | prepend: site.url }}" alt="game instructions" itemprop="image">

  <section itemprop="articleSection">
    <h4 itemprop="headline">
      Score
    </h4>
    <p>
      The results of the game is about how many points you did, and which where the answers of the game, this will help you to learn the game synonyms and antonyms eventhough you did not assert those values.
    </p>
    <p>
      May be those results where completely different than the ones we expected to be, and then thats the point, to see how close are those words to be synonyms / antonyms in which situation.
    </p>

      Conclusion
    </h4>
    <p>
    In this case I learnt about react native. This project was done 2 years ago, but never published, and the new React Hooks provides a different approach on working with React, so this project got old.
    On the other hand I was mainly learning about back end things, nodejs, scala, AWS with ec2 and rds instances. This was deployed using a cloud function of google cloud.
