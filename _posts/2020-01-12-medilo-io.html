      The art
    </h4>
    <p>
      Everything in this product was done by me, including images, and icons, we can see that they are not the best :) but we can improve it in the next version.

      Forever learning
    </h4>
    <p>
      During the creation of this application I learnt about:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        React Native: Navigation, Hooks, Async storage, etc...
      </li>
      <li>
        D3 for react native
      </li>
      <li>
        A bit, (just a bit) of Amplitude, as it is pretty a lot what can be done with this software. Similar to Google Tag Manager / Analytics etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        A bit of Illustrator, for the asset creation.
      </li>
      <li>
        A bit of video edition with Premiere Pro, for the short clip that promotes the application in youtube.
      </li>
      <li>
        ... and well you know all those adventures that makes learning so cool :).
      </li>
    </ul>
