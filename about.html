I am Juan José García, Information Systems Engineer, and I love to learn all the time new things, also teach some of them when I have the chance.

Always humble, grateful and open minded at work, in this oportunity I am sharing my knowledge with any one how wants or needs some of this material.

I was born in Argentina the 25th of October 1985. And this is blog is an index for those things I enjoy to do :), have a good stay.
